        <p>The modern <strong>English alphabet</strong> is a Latin alphabet consisting of 26 letters, each having an upper- and lower-case form. It originated around the 7th century from Latin script. Since then, letters have been added or removed to give the current Modern English alphabet of 26 letters with no diacritics, diagraphs, and special characters. The word alphabet is a compound of the first two letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and beta.
