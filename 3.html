        <h3>meaning</h3>
        <p>Written English has a large number of digraphs. It stands out almost uniquely as a European language without diacritics in native words. A diaeresis may be used to distinguish two vowels with separate pronunciation, such as "coöperation",[nb 1] from a double vowel.[1] Very occasionally, a grave may be used to indicate that a normally silent vowel is pronounced (as in learnèd, an adjective).</p>
